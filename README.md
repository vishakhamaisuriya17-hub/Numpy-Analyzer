# Numpy-Analyzer

A menu-driven, interactive command-line tool for creating, exploring, and analyzing NumPy arrays. Built entirely with Python and NumPy, it walks you through array creation, indexing/slicing, mathematical operations, combining/splitting, searching/sorting/filtering, and statistical analysis — all through a simple console interface.

## Features

- **Array Creation** — Build 1D, 2D, or 3D arrays by entering custom dimensions and elements
- **Indexing & Slicing** — Access individual elements or extract sub-arrays across any dimension
- **Mathematical Operations** — Add, subtract, multiply, or divide two arrays of the same shape
- **Combine or Split Arrays** — Stack/concatenate arrays together or split an array into multiple parts
- **Search, Sort & Filter** — Locate values, sort arrays (row-wise for 2D), or filter elements by condition
- **Aggregates & Statistics** — Compute sum, mean, median, standard deviation, and variance

## Project Structure

```
 Jupyter/
│   └── numpy_A.ipynb    # Main notebook containing the NumPy Analyzer program
└──----- README.md
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishakhamaisuriya17-hub/Numpy-Analyzer.git
   cd Numpy-Analyzer
   ```

2. Install the required dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage

Open and run `Jupyter/numpy_A.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab, or convert it to a script and run it from the terminal.

On launch, you'll see the main menu:

```
Welcome to the NumPy Analyzer!
======================================

Choose an option:
1. Create a NumPy Array
2. Perform Mathematical Operations
3. Combine or Split Arrays
4. Search, Sort, or Filter Arrays
5. Compute Aggregates and Statistics
6. Exit
```

Simply enter the number corresponding to the operation you'd like to perform, then follow the on-screen prompts to input array dimensions and values.

### Example Workflow

1. Select **1** to create a new array (choose 1D, 2D, or 3D and enter its elements)
2. Immediately after creation, you can index or slice the array
3. Return to the main menu and select **2**–**5** to perform further operations on the same array

## How It Works

The program is organized into modular functions, each handling one category of operations:

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `create_array()` | Builds a 1D, 2D, or 3D array from user input |
| `indexing_slicing()` | Retrieves elements or sub-arrays via indexing/slicing |
| `mathematical_operations()` | Performs element-wise arithmetic between two arrays |
| `combine_split()` | Combines two arrays or splits one into parts |
| `search_sort_filter()` | Searches, sorts, or filters array values |
| `aggregates_statistics()` | Calculates summary statistics for the array |
| `main()` | Drives the top-level menu loop |

## Notes

- 2D arrays are sorted **row-wise** by default.
- When combining two 2D arrays, they are joined using a **vertical stack** (`np.vstack`).
- Mathematical operations and combining arrays require the second array to match the shape of the original.
